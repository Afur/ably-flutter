[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/compare/b739b9d91499f4b9d81e5d9804063c4a8614ce80...3c9a78ee2b07d51be6d67365f49c27d02d5a2ef4)

The first pre-release candidate. Here is a quick list of supported APIs:

1. Creating a Rest/Realtime instance by passing ClientOptions

    * `ClientOptions` can be created by passing APIToken (`ClientOptions.fromKey`) or otherwise
    * `defaultTokenParams`, `authCallback`, `logHandler` are not supported yet

2. get a rest channel and publish message(s) - [name and data, or a message object or an array of messages]
3. Listening to Realtime Connection State Change using Stream subscriptions
4. Listening to Realtime Channel State Change on a channel using Stream subscriptions
5. connect and disconnect from a realtime channel
6. attach and detach from a realtime channel
7. Subscribing to messages on a realtime channel using Stream subscriptions.
    
    * Cancelling stream subscription will cancel the listener.

8. Publishing message(s) on a realtime channel - [name and data, or a message object or an array of messages]
